The resort's website is an important marketing and customer service tool. A well-designed website can advertise the resort's qualities and services to potential guests and make the reservation process easy.
The primary goal of our website is to connect vacation-seekers with luxurious places to stay so they may enjoy their downtime in style.
The majority of travellers have no idea what to expect from the hotels they're considering, and if they don't like the vibe at their hotel, they may get a negative impression of their destination as a result.
A resort's website is designed to be visually appealing and immersive, allowing visitors to truly feel like they are at the resort. 

Using high-quality photographs, films, and graphics that highlight the property's attractive features can help.
Also, I had picked the website's colour scheme, font, and layout with the user experience in mind. Because of the attractive and user-friendly website that I designed, more people are staying on it and making reservations.


The colours we're utilising will help us get there. Here, I chose a colour scheme of violet, black, sky blue, and white.
I had utilised these particular hues. In addition, I made a homepage, a resort booking page, and a landing page. My chosen colour scheme has a 60:20:20 ratio of colours.
The user's full name and email address are acquired during the data collection process. From my perspective, knowing the most basic details about guests who are visiting from out of town and staying at the resort is important in case anything should happen to them while they are in town.

I implemented this with the help of material ui and react. 

When it comes to building websites and apps, React.js is a top choice. It helps programmers make interactive and search engine optimised elements. Features built within React.js also help with upkeep and general efficiency. Adding the Material UI library to your React.js projects is a game-changer.

Simply said, Material-UI is a framework that facilitates the incorporation and use of various UI components for usage in the development of React applications. Since the developers won't have to create everything from scratch, this is a huge time saver.
Widgets in the Material-UI style take their cues from Google's guidelines for creating user interfaces. This makes it simple for programmers to design apps with pleasing aesthetics.

To build dynamic apps for mobile, web, and other platforms, React is an indispensable tool.
For good reason, React is becoming increasingly popular and widely used.

The map function of the React component NumberList is written entirely in JavaScript. You'll notice that JSX is just another common HTML element that doesn't make use of any special properties. The render method merely displays the HTML file's root element, which is a NumberList component.

It's a pain to set up a test browser for the classic user interface. However, testing in React requires next to no configuration.

This may not look simple, but behind the scenes, React has it covered. One advantage is that it prevents layout trashing, which occurs when a DOM element is moved or deleted and the browser must recalculate its position.

Usability is crucial to the success of any website. There shouldn't be any bumps in the road for guests trying to book their stay or navigate the site for information.
The website's menus, navigation, and booking system all need to be straightforward for this to be possible. Many visitors will be viewing the site on their smartphones or tablets, thus making the site mobile-friendly is essential.
